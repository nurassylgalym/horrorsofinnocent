                            Faridon, a 40-year-old man from Afghanistan's Baghlan Province, was held in a hospital for mental health issues for just over one week. He pleaded with doctors to extend his stay, reflecting the larger psychological epidemic in Afghanistan caused by decades of war and explosive violence. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            According to Afghanistan's Health Ministry, half of the population experiences stress due to the ongoing war, and a significant number suffer from conditions such as PTSD, depression, schizophrenia, extreme anxiety, and bipolar disorder. While some of these illnesses may be inherited, medical professionals believe that the country's mental health crisis has been worsened by four decades of armed conflict, suicide bombings, and airstrikes. 
                            <br>
                            <br>    
                            The International Psychosocial Organization estimates that 70% of the population needs psychological support, and these conditions linked to armed conflict are on the rise. A survey by Big Think reveals that one in five Afghans suffer from depression, the highest rate in the world. However, Afghanistan's medical infrastructure lacks psychological resources, and less than 10% of the population receives necessary treatment. This shortage leads to many Afghans either not seeking help or being prescribed psychotropic drugs. Additionally, a lack of mental health literacy contributes to the high number of opiate users in the country.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This report highlights the severe psychological impact of armed violence on Afghanistan, a society that has endured decades of conflict. Not only does violence increase the prevalence of mental health conditions, but it also damages the health infrastructure designed to treat them. The consequences of the war in Afghanistan are devastating for local residents, who face significant psychological trauma and limited access to mental health services. 
                            <br>
                            <br>    
                            Bashir Ahmad Sarwari, who heads the Afghan Ministry of Public Health's Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse, laments that mental health is not adequately understood at all levels of the system, hindering efforts to address this pressing national issue. "People do not know about mental health illness and come up with various names for sufferers – idiots, crazy, stupid, or haunted," he told Global Voices. Sarwari argues that the stigma towards mental health illness is pervasive, not only among ordinary Afghans but also among doctors, staff, politicians, and policymakers.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The Afghan Ministry of Public Health's "National Strategy for Mental Health" aims to strengthen leadership, governance, and research in mental health. However, these efforts will not be sustainable without an end to violence and explosive weapon use. The ongoing talks between the government and the Taliban are critical to the long-term well-being of Afghan civilians. It is essential for the international community to support these efforts by providing humanitarian aid, security, education, infrastructure, and economic development. Without this support, many Afghans would continue to suffer from poverty, violence, and instability, exacerbating the mental health crisis.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            By prioritizing mental health in Afghanistan, the country can begin to heal from the psychological scars of war and provide the necessary support for its residents to rebuild their lives. It is also important to recognize that the psychological consequences of the war in Afghanistan extend beyond the individual level. The collective trauma experienced by communities and the wider societal impact cannot be overlooked. Rebuilding trust, fostering social cohesion, and promoting resilience are key factors in addressing the psychological consequences of war and ensuring a sustainable peace.

                            I want you to imagine your mom. What are her interests? What’s her job? What university did she graduate from? And how well did she study at school? Now imagine that she never had the opportunity to get an education, even secondary, even educational courses were banned for her, there was no opportunity to express herself, most of her interests were prohibited, and it was impossible to sunbathe on the beach or wear clothes that show some skin, it was impossible even to leave the house without a man’s escort. Perhaps she would never even have met your father in this situation. But this is the reality that women live in Afghanistan now. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In mid-August 2021, the Taliban seized power in Kabul. Since then, the situation of women in the country has deteriorated dramatically. Their rights and freedoms are massively violated. They can no longer study, work, participate in public life, and even go out without a man’s escort. Women who once had dreams and aspirations are now confined to their homes, stripped of their autonomy and voice. 
                            <br>
                            <br>    
                            In August 2020, about 40 brave women demonstrated in Kabul in front of the Afghan Ministry of Education. They demanded "Bread, work, and freedom!". The Taliban reacted with violence, opening fire on the crowd of fleeing women, beating them with butts, and assaulting journalists who tried to cover the events. These women risked their lives to stand up for their rights, only to be met with brutality and oppression.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It is disheartening to think that just a few years ago, in 2014, Afghanistan was excluded from the list of countries with the worst indicators in the field of human rights. Progress was made through international pressure and the efforts of local activists. Education was provided to all girls, regardless of family income, and laws were passed to combat child marriage and domestic violence. There were even measures in place to support the representation of women in electoral councils. However, the gains made during those years are now being eroded, and the plight of Afghan women is once again in the hands of oppressors. 
                            <br>
                            <br>    
                            For over a century, women's rights in Afghanistan have been a battleground, with periods of progress followed by opposition and setbacks. It is a stark reminder of how a nation that granted women the right to vote in 1919, earlier than many Western countries, could still be accused of committing crimes against its female citizens. The recent events in Afghanistan, where 20 years of progress on women's rights have been nullified in just a few days, serve as an example of how fragile women's rights truly are.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In the face of this dire situation, continued international support and protection of women's rights in Afghanistan are of utmost importance. The global community must not turn a blind eye to the suffering of Afghan women. It is crucial to amplify their voices, provide resources and aid, and work towards a brighter future where Afghan women can live with dignity, equality, and freedom. Only through sustained efforts and solidarity can we prevent further regression and ensure that the rights of Afghan women are safeguarded.

                            The Afghan Ministry of Public Health's 'National Strategy for Mental Health' aims to strengthen leadership, governance, and research in mental health, but these efforts will not be sustainable without an end to violence and explosive weapon use. The ongoing talks between the government and the Taliban are critical to the long-term well-being of Afghan civilians.

                            Faridon, a 40-year-old man from Afghanistan's Baghlan Province, who was held in a hospital for mental health issues for just over one week, begged doctors to keep him in longer, reflecting the larger psychological epidemic in Afghanistan caused by decades of war and explosive violence. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Afghanistan's Health Ministry reports that half of the population experiences stress caused by the ongoing war, and a significant number suffer from conditions such as PTSD, depression, schizophrenia, extreme anxiety, and bipolar disorder. 
                            <br>
                            <br>    
                            While some of these illnesses may be inherited, medical professionals believe that the country's mental health crisis has been exacerbated by four decades of armed conflict, suicide bombings, and airstrikes.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The International Psychosocial Organization estimates that 70% of the population needs psychological support, with these conditions linked to armed conflict on the rise. According to a survey by Big Think, one in five Afghans suffer depression, more than anywhere in the world. 
                            <br>
                            <br>    
                            However, Afghanistan's medical infrastructure lacks psychological resources, with less than 10% of the population receiving necessary treatment.   This shortage leads to many Afghanis either not seeking help or being prescribed psychotropic drugs, while a lack of mental health literacy contributes to the high number of opiate users in the country.
                            This report emphasizes the severe psychological impact of armed violence on Afghanistan, a society that has endured decades of conflict. Not only does violence increase the prevalence of mental health conditions, but it also damages health infrastructure designed to treat them. It is crucial to improve mental health services and awareness to effectively treat victims and combat stigma.

                            Bashir Ahmad Sarwari, who heads the Afghan Ministry of Public Health's Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse, laments that mental health is not properly understood at all levels of the system, hindering efforts to address this pressing national issue.
