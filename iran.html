                            In the heart of Iran, among the hills and fragrant gardens, lived a boy named Mashhadi. His life was a portrait of serenity, painted with shades of love, laughter and dreams. Mashhadi's family lived in the picturesque city of Shiraz, in the south of Iran, famous for its lush vineyards and nearby historic Persepolis. Every day they had fun, played together and spent time in childish happiness. He blossomed in the warmth of his parents' arms and the company of his two brothers, Rashid and Abdullah, unaware of the storm lurking on the horizon. Mashhadi's days began with the soft golden embrace of sunrise, and his nights ended with the soothing lullaby of the crickets in the garden. Mashhadi's father, Mahmoud, was a gentle soul with calloused hands from working the land, and his mother, Farah, was a loving and nurturing presence in their home. It was a close-knit family, deeply rooted in their Iranian heritage, proud of their history and the rich cultural tapestry that surrounded them. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Mashhadi: grins: "Another beautiful day in our little paradise, isn't it, Father?"
                            Father: (smiling) "Indeed it is, my son. Life is a gift and this land is our treasure."
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            As the years passed, the family celebrated Nowruz, the Persian New Year, with traditional dishes such as sabzi polo and haft-seen, symbolising their hopes for the coming year. The aroma of Persian saffron filled the air as they prepared aromatic dishes such as Zereshk Polo and Koofteh Tabrizi. It was a time of joy and renewal for the family. But one frosty evening, as the family gathered around the dinner table, a distant rumbling echoed across the valley. At first they thought it was just a clap of thunder, but over time the distant rumble grew into an ominous thunderstorm that never stopped.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Rashid: (worried) "Did you hear that? It sounded like thunder."
                            Mother: (Frowning) "It hasn't rained for weeks. It wasn't thunder."
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In the darkness of one fateful night, a storm of a different kind came upon them. It was not rain, but shells and fire from the relentless conflict that had engulfed their tranquil town. The sky, once their refuge, now witnessed chaos, and Mashhadi, the boy who had never known fear, grabbed his little brother's trembling hand as their house collapsed around them. The world had become a nightmarish canvas of destruction and despair. His parents, pillars of strength, were now dying under merciless fire. The morning after the bombing, the sun rose over the devastated landscape. Mashhadi and his brother Rashid, once innocent boys, were now burdened with a heavy responsibility. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Amid the chaos, they grew from children into young men. Their days were a relentless struggle to survive. At dawn, they scoured the ruins of Shiraz in search of remnants of their past. There was little food and even less water. But amidst the ruins, the brothers forged an unbreakable bond that testified to their shared loss and eternal love for each other. Travelling along dangerous roads, they met others like them, survivors with haunted eyes and hearts scarred by tragedy. They whispered stories of perseverance and resistance, stories of those who refused to give in to the darkness that had fallen on their country. After long weeks of struggling to survive in a devastated city, Mashhadi and Rashid came across a man whose appearance and clothes were a strange contrast between the past and the future. This stranger wore a long cloak concealing an ancient sword, and on his head was a traditional Iranian cap. The stranger introduced himself as Ali, and his eyes, though war-weary, radiated kindness and hope. He told his brothers that he too had lost his family and home in this brutal war, but now he was looking for a way out. Mashhadi and Rashid joined Ali and together they set out to find a safe haven. Their joint efforts made them stronger, and they began to feel that there were other good souls in the world who were willing to help them and themselves in difficult times.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            One day, thanks to Ali's connections in the city, they received information about a place where they could find food and water. As they approached the place, however, they encountered a group of armed men charging in their direction. The men turned out to be members of a rival gang who controlled the resources in the area. The situation became tense and the brothers were ready to retreat to avoid conflict. But Ali decided to do things differently. He prepared for the meeting and, using his powers of persuasion and negotiation, was able to reach an agreement with the gang leader. They gave him food and water in exchange for a promise of future help. Thus began a strange relationship between the brothers, Ali and the gang. The brothers began to provide them with information on enemy troop movements and resources in exchange for protection and some supplies. It was a dangerous game, but they had no choice and it allowed them to survive.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Another day, as the brothers and Ali were about to pass on valuable information, they received a warning about the gang's plans. The gang leader was going to betray them to their enemies for a reward. Now they had to act quickly and cleverly. In the dead of night, they fled the gang's camp and headed west, hoping to find safer ground. But their pursuers were persistent, and their path was fraught with danger. And so, in the darkness of the night, when it seemed they had no hope of escape, they came across a woman called Leila. Leila lived in a remote village in the Zagros Mountains, a region known for its breathtaking natural beauty. Her village, nestled among rugged peaks and lush valleys, had remained untouched by the war that had ravaged the cities. Leila had lost her family during the conflict and had retreated to this remote village for solace. This mysterious woman, who lived in an abandoned house deep in the forest, gave her shelter and food. Leila told them about her family, which she had lost in the war, and about her mission to help those in need. Together with Leila, Mashhadi, Rashid and Ali formed a new family and decided to fight for peace and security in their country. They became part of the resistance movement, helping other survivors on their way to freedom and hope. Their adventures and struggles continued, but they knew that together they had a chance for a better future. They travelled through historic cities like Isfahan, where they marvelled at the stunning architecture of the Imam Mosque and explored the enchanting bazaars. They found refuge in ancient villages such as Abyaneh, known for its red mud houses and centuries-old traditions. Every place they visited was a reminder of Iran's rich history and the resilience of its people. As they travelled, they encountered the vibrant diversity of Iranian culture. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In Yazd, they were welcomed into the homes of Zoroastrian families who shared their traditions and stories. In Shiraz, they attended poetry recitals in the famous Hafezieh Garden and found solace in the verses of Hafez, the renowned Persian poet. The years passed and the war continued to cast its long shadow over Iran. But Mashhadi, Rashid, Ali and Leila remained steadfast in their determination to make a difference. They joined forces with other resistance groups across the country, creating a network of hope and solidarity.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            One of their most daring missions took them to the ancient city of Bam, which had suffered a devastating earthquake in the past. They worked alongside local volunteers to rebuild homes and provide aid to earthquake survivors. It was a testament to their commitment to rebuilding not only the physical infrastructure, but also the spirit of their nation. Their efforts have not gone unnoticed. Inspired by their resilience, people from all walks of life joined their cause. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Together, they organised peaceful protests calling for an end to the conflict and a better future for Iran. Their message of unity and hope echoed through the streets of Tehran, Isfahan and beyond. Over time, international attention focused on Iran's plight, and diplomatic efforts to end the war intensified. The voices of the people, amplified by the actions of Mashhadi, Rashid, Ali and Leila, played a crucial role in the peace negotiations. Finally, after years of turmoil, a ceasefire agreement was reached, ending the devastating war. Iran, a nation scarred by conflict, was now on the cusp of rebuilding and healing.

                            I need two or maybe three hours. I need to use two cars: one from our house to the checkpoint, then walk through the checkpoint, and finally take another car from the checkpoint to Abu Dis on the other side.
                            ❝Once we were going to a wedding in Abu Dis, one of our relatives was getting married. But the Israelis closed the checkpoint. We were all ready for the wedding, but they prevented us from going to Abu Dis.
                            <br>
                            <br>    
                            ❝We stayed for one hour at the checkpoint, talked to them, to convince them to allow us through. In the end, we all became stressed and returned home. We did not attend the wedding.
                            ❝Our location is very difficult. No one can visit us. Really, it’s very difficult for us. My hope is to wake up one morning to find that there is no Separation Wall.❞
