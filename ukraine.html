                        It began exactly five months after the start of the war.  Then these nonhumans showed up in our village.  No one could imagine what atrocities they would do.   
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For how many years they covered themselves with the phrase “Friendly people, we are brothers”, at the same time sharpening the knives that they stabbed into our backs.
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        They came to us on August 24, mercilessly crushing all our property, livestock, even people with tanks ... then it seemed the most terrible thing.  Orcs without any problems selected the best houses, and those who did not agree to provide them were killed in their own courtyard, after which, like garbage, they were taken out of the door. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After a week of the stay of these pigs in our urban-type settlement, local residents noticed that women began to disappear when they left for work.  "She left and did not return" - it now sounded from every alley.  Everyone understood what was happening. 
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        One day, four Russian soldiers showed up at our house, they were not very kind.  They broke down the front doors and entered the house screaming. I can't tell you verbatim, but they demanded food, threatening my wife's life.  What we gave away seemed insufficient to the soldiers.  To get more food, they began to beat me, in the expectation that my wife still hid something.  When they realized that there was nothing in the house, they killed her.  I sat on the floor next to her while these beasts carried out the TV and the microwave. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And unfortunately, the story doesn't end there. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Soon they began to terrorize everyone and everything, forbidding people to leave the house to go to the store or even to the toilet.  There were cases when elderly people died, even then, they forbade taking the dead out of the house and burying them. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        These non-humans forced their relatives to sit with these corpses for several weeks, and then they said: “You won’t bury it, you’ll bury it in the garden and that’s enough.  Whoever disobeys will lie beside him."  Cutting off a dog's paw or shooting all the cats, and then butchering them, was a familiar pastime for them.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Everything that happened then is a real hell, and the Russians are the main devil in it.  They spare no one and nothing.  They came here with one goal, to destroy absolutely everything that comes their way.

                        Fear… is one feeling that haunted us all the time.  We stayed in the occupation for 6 months, what a living hell the inhabitants experienced. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It all started with a harmless, in the opinion of the Russians, violence against cows and dogs.  Just imagine what these creatures are!  They were able to rape animals, and not only living ones.  They mocked even the dead, doing things that are terrible even to say.  
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        Even then, the whole village did not leave their homes.  Most often they sat in basements, but even these pigs managed to enter there, nonhumans - Russian soldiers. They began to forcefully pull out young girls.  I had to attend.  Then we sat in the basement of the neighbors.  They had a young daughter, sixteen years old.  Fortunately, my children have not been in the village for a long time.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                         One evening they knocked on the basement door, they opened it, because if they had not opened it, they would have shot on the spot, right through the same doors.  Entering the room, they said only these two cursed words: "Choose whom", pointing to this girl and her mother.  They did not take me, perhaps they did not need a 67-year-old old woman.  Her father attacked them with his fists, demanding to leave the territory, as a result of which he was shot dead ... I cannot describe how many tears, tantrums and pain there were that night.  They took their daughter… half a year after the de-occupation, her body was found mutilated in a field not far from the village, in a common pit, with another hundred bodies. 
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        From that moment on, all the girls in the village were cut bald, walked in old rags, so that no one would even look at them.  But everything continued, after the girls they began to take away the men.  They were also raped, only at the same time they poured out.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The book became Iris Chan's main source of fame. She has earned great respect in China, grateful for the increased awareness of Western readers about the Nanjing massacre. At the same time, Chan received angry emails, mostly from Japanese ultranationalists. Threatening notes were left on her car, she also believed that her phone was tapped.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Chan's mother said the book "upset Iris." Suffering from clinical depression, Chan was diagnosed with reactive psychosis in August 2004. She started taking medication in order to stabilize her mood. However, on November 9, 2004, Chan committed suicide. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In China, the survivors of the Nanjing massacre held a memorial service that coincided with her funeral in Los Altos, California. The Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall, a memorial in Nanjing built in memory of its victims, added a wing dedicated to Chan to its building in 2005.

                        The names of those killed in the Nanking Massacre will forever remain in the memory of descendants, and the bloody events of 1937 will never disappear from the memory of survivors.

                        Nanjing Massacre survivor Xia Shuqin said: “I was only 8 at the time. The Japanese hit me painfully three times - here, here and in the back. I lost consciousness. When I woke up after a very long time, I was covered in blood, but I didn’t know. what happened." Xia Shuqin's family consisted of 7 people, but only she and her 4-year-old sister survived. She noted: “My uncle and his children took refuge in the security zone, and when I lost my house, they took me there too.” 
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        Nanjing Massacre survivor Xia Shuqin stressed: “I want justice for those who died. Even if I am the only survivor, I will fight for Japan to admit its guilt. Then and only then will I achieve peace and stop talking about it.”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The survivors of that terrible time are desperately awaiting repentance from the Japanese side. They leave one after another - the list of victims on the memorial wall grows longer. And the more names there are in it, the more strongly it is imprinted in history. According to the Chinese side, during 6 weeks of atrocities, the Japanese military killed about 300 thousand residents of Nanjing with particular cruelty, and thousands of women were subjected to violence.

                        Today, The Nanjing Massacre is also known as “The Rape of Nanjing,” which represents gender-based violence directly and inspirs fictional writers to depict the tragedy of women. Yan Geling’s novel The Flowers of War and Zhang Yimou’s film adapted from that novel are examples. In this article, through a comparison of Iris Chang’s The Rape of Nanking and two versions of The Flowers of War, I examine how Yan and Zhang apply the historical materials to portray the interaction between women and calamity. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Iris Chang in her novel presents "rape" from a global viewpoint in The Rape of Nanking. First, women are raped by patriarchy. Women were in grave peril in the male-dominated society of East Asia. Women were trained to be soft and meek by society, but when the conflict actually broke out, males gave up and ran away. Another definition of "rape" is when a greater nation mistreats a weaker one. Stronger nations refused China's request for assistance throughout the conflict and later forgot the Nanjing Massacre. Chang, on the other hand, interprets "rape" from a single point of view and is able to uncover "hope" in the conflict when he transforms the Nanjing Massacre into fictional works. 
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        Yan Geling describes the issues with patriarchy in the novel The Flowers of War but fails to effectively depict the larger global picture. She describes how women employ their mature reproductive organs to give birth (again). In contrast, Zhang Yimou places a strong emphasis on the global setting in his movie. He puts out the notion that the dying Oriental civilisation may be saved by the Western faith. In this thesis, I contend that although Zhang looks to Western cultures as an external force to heal Chinese trauma, Yan depicts how the inner strength of Chinese women's bodies helps them overcome the crisis of death in the novel The Flowers of War. However, both of these narrative ploys highlight the following issues: Yan depicts the mistreatment of women, whereas Zhang displays the self-Orientalism tendency.

                        “In 1937, on the 11 day of the 11 lunar month, the Japanese army occupied the city. After taking over the city, they massacred residents and set the area on fire. The Japanese forces slaughtered my husband and my older brother.  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We ran away at that point and took refuge in Dafang Lane. My children were five and three years old. I was also pregnant.  My husband Li Dianrong was taken away by the Japanese army when he sent us quilts. I sobbed while looking everywhere for him. But all I found were the quilts. My spouse was not one of the dead when I removed the reed mat to look at them. Later, I learned that the Japanese soldiers killed my husband. We had to go to the Huai'an countryside since we were unable to live without him and with only the aged and young in the family. Japanese forces also killed my older brother. And my mother died in sadness because of the death of her son and son-in-law. 
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        I personally witnessed a Japanese soldier hacking a pedestrian in the back, splitting him in half, and causing him to collapse to the ground. Additionally, two more soldiers killed.  The Japanese soldiers hacked off the other man's head and kicked it with their foot after tearing open the stomach of one of the men.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The current location of No. 4 Middle School, which at the time was known as Sanmin Middle School, the library, and IWHR were all in the neighborhood of numerous deaths caused by the Japanese army at that time. Additionally, several civilians outside Hanzhong Gate were shot by machine guns”.
