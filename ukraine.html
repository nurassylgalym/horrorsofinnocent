                        It began exactly five months after the start of the war.  Then these nonhumans showed up in our village.  No one could imagine what atrocities they would do.   
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For how many years they covered themselves with the phrase “Friendly people, we are brothers”, at the same time sharpening the knives that they stabbed into our backs.
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        They came to us on August 24, mercilessly crushing all our property, livestock, even people with tanks ... then it seemed the most terrible thing.  Orcs without any problems selected the best houses, and those who did not agree to provide them were killed in their own courtyard, after which, like garbage, they were taken out of the door. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After a week of the stay of these pigs in our urban-type settlement, local residents noticed that women began to disappear when they left for work.  "She left and did not return" - it now sounded from every alley.  Everyone understood what was happening. 
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        One day, four Russian soldiers showed up at our house, they were not very kind.  They broke down the front doors and entered the house screaming. I can't tell you verbatim, but they demanded food, threatening my wife's life.  What we gave away seemed insufficient to the soldiers.  To get more food, they began to beat me, in the expectation that my wife still hid something.  When they realized that there was nothing in the house, they killed her.  I sat on the floor next to her while these beasts carried out the TV and the microwave. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And unfortunately, the story doesn't end there. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Soon they began to terrorize everyone and everything, forbidding people to leave the house to go to the store or even to the toilet.  There were cases when elderly people died, even then, they forbade taking the dead out of the house and burying them. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        These non-humans forced their relatives to sit with these corpses for several weeks, and then they said: “You won’t bury it, you’ll bury it in the garden and that’s enough.  Whoever disobeys will lie beside him."  Cutting off a dog's paw or shooting all the cats, and then butchering them, was a familiar pastime for them.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Everything that happened then is a real hell, and the Russians are the main devil in it.  They spare no one and nothing.  They came here with one goal, to destroy absolutely everything that comes their way.

                        Fear… is one feeling that haunted us all the time.  We stayed in the occupation for 6 months, what a living hell the inhabitants experienced. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It all started with a harmless, in the opinion of the Russians, violence against cows and dogs.  Just imagine what these creatures are!  They were able to rape animals, and not only living ones.  They mocked even the dead, doing things that are terrible even to say.  
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        Even then, the whole village did not leave their homes.  Most often they sat in basements, but even these pigs managed to enter there, nonhumans - Russian soldiers. They began to forcefully pull out young girls.  I had to attend.  Then we sat in the basement of the neighbors.  They had a young daughter, sixteen years old.  Fortunately, my children have not been in the village for a long time.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        One evening they knocked on the basement door, they opened it, because if they had not opened it, they would have shot on the spot, right through the same doors.  Entering the room, they said only these two cursed words: "Choose whom", pointing to this girl and her mother.  They did not take me, perhaps they did not need a 67-year-old old woman.  Her father attacked them with his fists, demanding to leave the territory, as a result of which he was shot dead ... I cannot describe how many tears, tantrums and pain there were that night.  They took their daughter… half a year after the de-occupation, her body was found mutilated in a field not far from the village, in a common pit, with another hundred bodies. 
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        From that moment on, all the girls in the village were cut bald, walked in old rags, so that no one would even look at them.  But everything continued, after the girls they began to take away the men.  They were also raped, only at the same time they poured out.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                         A couple of days before the liberation of our territory, when there were already 40 people left in the whole village, the most terrible thing began.  They took the babies… And then they raped the kids in front of their parents.  These were children no older than 6 months ... There were also two-year-old children, five-year-olds.  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Whoever survived, they sent home, where, upon their arrival, the children hanged themselves ... That's what war is - terrible, dirty, hellish hatred.  These are our realities.

                        Today I will talk about something that is absolutely not customary to talk in society.  This is what happens during the war and after.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For some reason, people forget to talk about what really happens to the soldiers who have returned home.  These people have already lost everything, their family, faith in the main brain.  No matter how scary it may sound, but they return inadequate.
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                         I had to be in such situations.  I live in a private house, where military men live around, on neighboring streets, and also near the house.  You would know what happens when they come home for a few days.  One day, sitting in the courtyard in the evening, I heard shots, there were about 10 of them, going out into the street I saw a military man who literally shot at everyone and everything.  After, he explained it: “What?!  I do not have a right?  I'm protecting all of you freaks."  As a result, neighbors' fences were damaged and small children were frightened.  Often there were cases of rape of a girl, this was done by the military.  And the worst thing is that they went unpunished, because they fulfilled their duty to their homeland.  There were cases of robbery, murders in stores and just on the streets.  When anarchy was going on in the country, people had no choice. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After all, it was basically unrealistic to change something, because the state could not send them for treatment to a psychiatric clinic, because there is a crisis in the country, there is no money.

                        Just imagine, you live an ordinary life, in which everything goes at a measured pace, plans for the future, study, work, travel, and then bam, and everything that was present before disappears abruptly, in addition, completely taking away your future, accompanying it with a huge rumble  and the howl of a disgusting sound. You seem to be locked in a cage in which you have only the present, there can be no talk of any future.  From that moment on, we started running to the basement.  And if you think that the basement is the second equipped house, then you are mistaken, because this is a cold, damp room, in which there are only conservation and shelving.  We spent the first three months there.  Constant lack of sleep, irritation and fear - were true friends.  Sometime in June, a cluster shell fell two meters from my house.  I cannot describe the full range of emotions that was present at that moment.  Somehow I jumped out of bed, taking the chinchilla by the arm, managed to run into the basement and in a hurry close the door behind the trembling dog.  We were saved by the fact that it did not burst, otherwise, I would not be writing this text now.  During the month we tried to come to our senses, but the Russians (I write it wrong in vain, as a sign of utter disrespect to them) had other plans. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Three days before my birthday, these entities blew up the dam.  Then half of the city was flooded, washing away not only the property of people, but also their lives.  After winter followed, this time of the year was perhaps the most difficult.  In those months, these creatures bombed the energy system of our state, for the first time black out caught us in the month of December.  You probably do not understand what this is, so I will explain.  Black out is a certain period of time in which there is no light throughout the country due to rocket attacks, it is also accompanied by the disconnection of cellular communications, the Internet, heating and television. That is, there is nothing at all.  You do not hear any sirens (since they work on electricity), or notifications on the phone (since he has long since sat down), and as a result, you are completely unarmed.  Then the phone became an empty piece of iron, which is not even able to provide information.  This went on for about three days.  Then, they began to turn off the light according to the schedule, it was 5 hours a day, no more.  Just think about how our lives have been cut.  Not only was it cold outside, the Internet was also not the best, but the training continued, no one canceled anything.  Since the new year, shelling has become frequent, so studying in the basement during the explosions has become the norm, I sometimes spent 6 hours there, because it was at least some kind of security measure.  With the onset of heat, they began to shell more often, because now we were the frontline zone.  Strange as it may seem, but at such a moment you realize that the basement is literally a coffin, if it flies nearby, it will save you from fragments and a little from the blast wave (although taking into account the fact that people are torn to the guts from it, it is unlikely -  li), but if there is a direct hit on the house, you will die at the same second.  
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        After some more time, I began to distinguish between rockets, drones and everything that flew at us, but the most disgusting thing is that we figured out one thing - if you see a rocket, but don’t hear the sound, you are a walking corpse, and that’s for a couple  seconds.  Well, the last thing I have enough for is the Kakhovka reservoir.  Orcs (as we call the Russians) blew up a dam on the largest reservoir in our country early in the morning.  The volume of water that descended on the Kherson region could not be counted.  In private houses, there was no roof visible, and in high-rise buildings, water stood up to the seventh floor.  Since at that time the left bank was still under occupation, the orcs forbade the evacuation of people, there are still a ton of corpses left there.

                        People and animals were rescued from the right bank whenever possible; people sat on the roofs of their own houses for a week, choking in the dirtiest water that washed away graves, latrines, flower beds, and food. 
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        This is not only a catastrophe on a global scale, it is a catastrophe that destroyed and took hundreds of lives.  Therefore, if you are told that war is not a horror and that it only concerns the military, never believe these people.
