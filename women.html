                            War affects women in various ways, both directly and indirectly. Some of the common impacts include:
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <div style="font-size: 18px" class="work__cat">
                            1. Physical and sexual violence: Women often become targets of physical and sexual violence during times of war. They may experience rape, forced prostitution, sexual slavery, and other forms of abuse.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            2. Displacement and refugee crisis: Women and children constitute the majority of displaced populations during conflicts. They may have to flee their homes and become refugees, facing challenges such as lack of shelter, food, healthcare, and safety.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            3. Loss of family and loved ones: Women often suffer the loss of family members, including husbands, fathers, sons, and brothers, who may be killed or forcibly conscripted into armed groups.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            4. Psychological trauma: Women are susceptible to psychological trauma as a result of witnessing or experiencing violence, displacement, and the loss of loved ones. They may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            5. Economic hardships: During war, women often lose their livelihoods and economic independence. They may face challenges in finding employment or accessing resources, which can lead to poverty and inequality.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            6. Limited access to healthcare: Women's access to healthcare, including reproductive and maternal healthcare, may be severely disrupted during conflicts, leading to increased risks of complications in pregnancy, childbirth, and limited access to essential medical services.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            7. Disruption of education: Conflict disrupts education systems, and girls often face barriers in accessing education during and after war. This lack of education limits their opportunities for personal and economic development.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            8. Involvement in armed conflict: Women may be forced to join armed groups, either voluntarily or involuntarily, as combatants, spies, or support staff. This exposes them to further risks and violence.

                        It is important to note that women also play essential roles as peacemakers, activists, and advocates for peace and reconciliation in conflict-affected areas. However, their contributions are often overlooked or undermined.

                        Conflict disrupts societies and individual families; violence against women proliferates

                        in such circumstances. Though war is perceived as a male activity—and indeed those involved in militaristic actions are overwhelmingly men—it is largely civilian women and children who bear the costs in the many civil wars of our time.  Bosnian War affected women intensely and disastrously. In addition to the complications of caring for a family during wartime, women there faced displacement from home, separation from loved ones, and extreme abuse, including rape, torture, and death. According to the statistics by Intereconomics, approximately half of the displaced Bosnians women fled to Serbia, Montenegro and Croatia. The vast majority of the other half, consisting largely of Muslim Bosniaks, fled to Western European countries.

                        <br>
                        The flight and forced migration of refugees during the war took place under a wide range of conditions, from women fleeing with their families to women being kid- napped by rebel forces. And the journeys themselves have a remarkable variety of dangers, from robbers preying upon the travelers to landmines blowing them up. Women who escape from their homes, communities, and their countries face hardships beyond their control, especially during times of conflict. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        - “We headed for the unknown, overwhelmed by fear,” recalls a woman from Sarajevo, Bosnia, of her flight.  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        - “We passed through the part of the city where all the houses were burned, destroyed, and deserted. I left behind all the comfort I had, which I experienced as major violence,” recalls another woman from Tuzla, Bosnia. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        On the road, women were forced to trade sex for food, suste- nance, or protection. Woman, who survived the war that began in 1992 states, “Our bodies were exchanged for food. The rebels were in charge of all the food in the country at that time. Some women that had pride, high esteem, they would rather die from hunger. But if you wanted to live, you had to have some connection with a rebel.”  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Forced migration affects everyone, but for most of the world’s women, the home is the most important place in the world, providing shelter, a space to nurture children, possible respite from violence in the streets, and, for some women, their only locus of social activities. Thus, women may be dis-proportionately affected psychologically and physically by being forced out of their homes and having those dwellings destroyed.

                    <p>"Violence against women can end only when the culprits get punished." - Mukhtar Ma'i</p>
                    <p>"Violence against women is perhaps the most shameful human rights violation, and it is perhaps the most pervasive. It knows no boundaries of geography, culture or wealth. As long as it continues, we cannot claim to be making real progress towards equality, development and peace." - Kofi Annan</p>
