                        "Forgetting history is a betrayal, and denying a crime is its repetition," the Chinese president said in an address to the people. Whatever the head of the People's Republic of China thinks at the same time, I want to emphasize that first of all it concerns brutally tortured and murdered women and girls. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In December 1937, during the Sino-Japanese War, soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army killed thousands of residents of Nanjing, which was then the capital of China.
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        According to evidence presented to the war Crimes court in Tokyo, Japanese soldiers raped 80,000 Chinese women, many of whom were subsequently killed. Women of all classes were raped, including Buddhist nuns. The murders were committed with particular cruelty. Firearms used by Japanese soldiers were not used. (Careful, further descriptions of atrocities) Thousands of victims were bayoneted, their heads were cut off, people were burned, buried alive, women's stomachs were ripped open and their insides were turned out, small children were killed. They raped and then brutally killed not only adult women, but also little girls, as well as elderly women. Pregnant women had their stomachs ripped open after being raped and the fetus was pulled out.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Yon Rabe's diary, which he kept during the battle for the city and its occupation by the Japanese army, describes numerous cases of Japanese brutality. Entry from December 17: "Two Japanese soldiers climbed over the wall and were about to break into my house. When I showed up, they said they allegedly saw two Chinese soldiers climbing over the wall. When I showed them the party badge, they disappeared in the same way. In one of the houses on a narrow street outside my garden wall, a woman was raped and then wounded in the neck with a bayonet. I managed to call an ambulance, and we sent her to the hospital… It is said that last night about 1,000 women and girls were raped, about a hundred girls in Jinling College alone… Nothing is heard except rapes. If husbands or brothers intercede, they are shot. All you see and hear is the brutality and atrocities of the Japanese soldiers." 
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        There is no unambiguous explanation of what made the Japanese like animals. Historian Jonathan Spence writes: "Japanese soldiers, who expected an easy victory, instead fought for months and suffered much more serious losses than they expected. They were tired, embittered, frustrated and tired. There was no one to protect Chinese women, men were either absent or powerless. The war, which has not yet been declared, had no clear and measurable goals. Perhaps they considered all Chinese people, regardless of gender and age, suitable for the role of victim."

                        "The Woman Who Could Not Forget: Who is Iris Chang?" 
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div style="font-size: 18px" class="work__cat">
                        When Iris Chan was a child, her parents, who fled from China to Taiwan after World War II and then to the United States, told the girl that during the Nanjing massacre, the Japanese "cut the children not into two, but into three or four parts." In the preface to The Rape of Nanjing, Chan writes that in her childhood, the Nanjing massacre "was buried in the background of reason as a metaphor for unpronounceable evil." When she got to public libraries, including the school library, and found nothing on this topic, she was surprised that no one had written a book about what had happened. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The theme of the Nanjing Massacre invaded Chan's life again almost two decades later when she learned about the filmmakers who had finished a documentary about the event. One of them was Shao Tzuping, who had previously helped make Magee's Testament, a film featuring a video chronicle of the Nanjing Massacre itself, shot by missionary John Magee. 
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        Chan began to communicate with Shao and soon joined the circle of activists who considered it their duty to contribute to documenting and publishing materials about the Nanjing massacre
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        About the the book – it  describes in detail the murders, tortures and rapes that took place during the Nanjing massacre. Chan lists and describes the types of torture faced by local residents, including burial alive, self-mutilation, burning, freezing, dog baiting. Based on the testimony of a survivor of the massacre, Chan also describes a speed killing contest between Japanese servicemen. About the rapes that took place during the massacre, the author writes, "of course, it was one of the largest mass rapes in world history." She estimates the number of women gang-raped at 20,000-80,000 people and states that the victims were women of all classes, including Buddhist nuns. In addition, rapes occurred everywhere and at any time of the day, and the victims were women of all ages. 
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        Rape and pregnant women were not spared. Chan writes that after gang rapes, Japanese soldiers "sometimes opened the bellies of pregnant women for entertainment and took out the fetus." Not all rape victims were women — Chinese men were also raped and forced to commit disgusting sexual acts. Some were forced to incest — fathers were forced to rape their own daughters, brothers — their sisters, sons — their mothers. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The book became Iris Chan's main source of fame. She has earned great respect in China, grateful for the increased awareness of Western readers about the Nanjing massacre. At the same time, Chan received angry emails, mostly from Japanese ultranationalists. Threatening notes were left on her car, she also believed that her phone was tapped.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Chan's mother said the book "upset Iris." Suffering from clinical depression, Chan was diagnosed with reactive psychosis in August 2004. She started taking medication in order to stabilize her mood. However, on November 9, 2004, Chan committed suicide. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In China, the survivors of the Nanjing massacre held a memorial service that coincided with her funeral in Los Altos, California. The Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall, a memorial in Nanjing built in memory of its victims, added a wing dedicated to Chan to its building in 2005.

                        The names of those killed in the Nanking Massacre will forever remain in the memory of descendants, and the bloody events of 1937 will never disappear from the memory of survivors.

                        Nanjing Massacre survivor Xia Shuqin said: “I was only 8 at the time. The Japanese hit me painfully three times - here, here and in the back. I lost consciousness. When I woke up after a very long time, I was covered in blood, but I didn’t know. what happened." Xia Shuqin's family consisted of 7 people, but only she and her 4-year-old sister survived. She noted: “My uncle and his children took refuge in the security zone, and when I lost my house, they took me there too.” 
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        Nanjing Massacre survivor Xia Shuqin stressed: “I want justice for those who died. Even if I am the only survivor, I will fight for Japan to admit its guilt. Then and only then will I achieve peace and stop talking about it.”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The survivors of that terrible time are desperately awaiting repentance from the Japanese side. They leave one after another - the list of victims on the memorial wall grows longer. And the more names there are in it, the more strongly it is imprinted in history. According to the Chinese side, during 6 weeks of atrocities, the Japanese military killed about 300 thousand residents of Nanjing with particular cruelty, and thousands of women were subjected to violence.

                        Today, The Nanjing Massacre is also known as “The Rape of Nanjing,” which represents gender-based violence directly and inspirs fictional writers to depict the tragedy of women. Yan Geling’s novel The Flowers of War and Zhang Yimou’s film adapted from that novel are examples. In this article, through a comparison of Iris Chang’s The Rape of Nanking and two versions of The Flowers of War, I examine how Yan and Zhang apply the historical materials to portray the interaction between women and calamity. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Iris Chang in her novel presents "rape" from a global viewpoint in The Rape of Nanking. First, women are raped by patriarchy. Women were in grave peril in the male-dominated society of East Asia. Women were trained to be soft and meek by society, but when the conflict actually broke out, males gave up and ran away. Another definition of "rape" is when a greater nation mistreats a weaker one. Stronger nations refused China's request for assistance throughout the conflict and later forgot the Nanjing Massacre. Chang, on the other hand, interprets "rape" from a single point of view and is able to uncover "hope" in the conflict when he transforms the Nanjing Massacre into fictional works. 
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        Yan Geling describes the issues with patriarchy in the novel The Flowers of War but fails to effectively depict the larger global picture. She describes how women employ their mature reproductive organs to give birth (again). In contrast, Zhang Yimou places a strong emphasis on the global setting in his movie. He puts out the notion that the dying Oriental civilisation may be saved by the Western faith. In this thesis, I contend that although Zhang looks to Western cultures as an external force to heal Chinese trauma, Yan depicts how the inner strength of Chinese women's bodies helps them overcome the crisis of death in the novel The Flowers of War. However, both of these narrative ploys highlight the following issues: Yan depicts the mistreatment of women, whereas Zhang displays the self-Orientalism tendency.

                        “In 1937, on the 11 day of the 11 lunar month, the Japanese army occupied the city. After taking over the city, they massacred residents and set the area on fire. The Japanese forces slaughtered my husband and my older brother.  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We ran away at that point and took refuge in Dafang Lane. My children were five and three years old. I was also pregnant.  My husband Li Dianrong was taken away by the Japanese army when he sent us quilts. I sobbed while looking everywhere for him. But all I found were the quilts. My spouse was not one of the dead when I removed the reed mat to look at them. Later, I learned that the Japanese soldiers killed my husband. We had to go to the Huai'an countryside since we were unable to live without him and with only the aged and young in the family. Japanese forces also killed my older brother. And my mother died in sadness because of the death of her son and son-in-law. 
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        I personally witnessed a Japanese soldier hacking a pedestrian in the back, splitting him in half, and causing him to collapse to the ground. Additionally, two more soldiers killed.  The Japanese soldiers hacked off the other man's head and kicked it with their foot after tearing open the stomach of one of the men.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The current location of No. 4 Middle School, which at the time was known as Sanmin Middle School, the library, and IWHR were all in the neighborhood of numerous deaths caused by the Japanese army at that time. Additionally, several civilians outside Hanzhong Gate were shot by machine guns”.

                        "Forgetting history is a betrayal, and denying a crime is its repetition," the Chinese president said in an address to the people. Whatever the head of the People's Republic of China thinks at the same time, I want to emphasize that first of all it concerns brutally tortured and murdered women and girls. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In December 1937, during the Sino-Japanese War, soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army killed thousands of residents of Nanjing, which was then the capital of China.
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        According to evidence presented to the war Crimes court in Tokyo, Japanese soldiers raped 80,000 Chinese women, many of whom were subsequently killed. Women of all classes were raped, including Buddhist nuns. The murders were committed with particular cruelty. Firearms used by Japanese soldiers were not used. (Careful, further descriptions of atrocities) Thousands of victims were bayoneted, their heads were cut off, people were burned, buried alive, women's stomachs were ripped open and their insides were turned out, small children were killed. They raped and then brutally killed not only adult women, but also little girls, as well as elderly women. Pregnant women had their stomachs ripped open after being raped and the fetus was pulled out.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Yon Rabe's diary, which he kept during the battle for the city and its occupation by the Japanese army, describes numerous cases of Japanese brutality. Entry from December 17: "Two Japanese soldiers climbed over the wall and were about to break into my house. When I showed up, they said they allegedly saw two Chinese soldiers climbing over the wall. When I showed them the party badge, they disappeared in the same way. In one of the houses on a narrow street outside my garden wall, a woman was raped and then wounded in the neck with a bayonet. I managed to call an ambulance, and we sent her to the hospital… It is said that last night about 1,000 women and girls were raped, about a hundred girls in Jinling College alone… Nothing is heard except rapes. If husbands or brothers intercede, they are shot. All you see and hear is the brutality and atrocities of the Japanese soldiers." 
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        There is no unambiguous explanation of what made the Japanese like animals. Historian Jonathan Spence writes: "Japanese soldiers, who expected an easy victory, instead fought for months and suffered much more serious losses than they expected. They were tired, embittered, frustrated and tired. There was no one to protect Chinese women, men were either absent or powerless. The war, which has not yet been declared, had no clear and measurable goals. Perhaps they considered all Chinese people, regardless of gender and age, suitable for the role of victim."

                        "The Woman Who Could Not Forget: Who is Iris Chang?" 
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div style="font-size: 18px" class="work__cat">
                        When Iris Chan was a child, her parents, who fled from China to Taiwan after World War II and then to the United States, told the girl that during the Nanjing massacre, the Japanese "cut the children not into two, but into three or four parts." In the preface to The Rape of Nanjing, Chan writes that in her childhood, the Nanjing massacre "was buried in the background of reason as a metaphor for unpronounceable evil." When she got to public libraries, including the school library, and found nothing on this topic, she was surprised that no one had written a book about what had happened. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The theme of the Nanjing Massacre invaded Chan's life again almost two decades later when she learned about the filmmakers who had finished a documentary about the event. One of them was Shao Tzuping, who had previously helped make Magee's Testament, a film featuring a video chronicle of the Nanjing Massacre itself, shot by missionary John Magee. 
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        Chan began to communicate with Shao and soon joined the circle of activists who considered it their duty to contribute to documenting and publishing materials about the Nanjing massacre
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        About the the book – it  describes in detail the murders, tortures and rapes that took place during the Nanjing massacre. Chan lists and describes the types of torture faced by local residents, including burial alive, self-mutilation, burning, freezing, dog baiting. Based on the testimony of a survivor of the massacre, Chan also describes a speed killing contest between Japanese servicemen. About the rapes that took place during the massacre, the author writes, "of course, it was one of the largest mass rapes in world history." She estimates the number of women gang-raped at 20,000-80,000 people and states that the victims were women of all classes, including Buddhist nuns. In addition, rapes occurred everywhere and at any time of the day, and the victims were women of all ages. 
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        Rape and pregnant women were not spared. Chan writes that after gang rapes, Japanese soldiers "sometimes opened the bellies of pregnant women for entertainment and took out the fetus." Not all rape victims were women — Chinese men were also raped and forced to commit disgusting sexual acts. Some were forced to incest — fathers were forced to rape their own daughters, brothers — their sisters, sons — their mothers. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The book became Iris Chan's main source of fame. She has earned great respect in China, grateful for the increased awareness of Western readers about the Nanjing massacre. At the same time, Chan received angry emails, mostly from Japanese ultranationalists. Threatening notes were left on her car, she also believed that her phone was tapped.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Chan's mother said the book "upset Iris." Suffering from clinical depression, Chan was diagnosed with reactive psychosis in August 2004. She started taking medication in order to stabilize her mood. However, on November 9, 2004, Chan committed suicide. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In China, the survivors of the Nanjing massacre held a memorial service that coincided with her funeral in Los Altos, California. The Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall, a memorial in Nanjing built in memory of its victims, added a wing dedicated to Chan to its building in 2005.

                        The names of those killed in the Nanking Massacre will forever remain in the memory of descendants, and the bloody events of 1937 will never disappear from the memory of survivors.

                        Nanjing Massacre survivor Xia Shuqin said: “I was only 8 at the time. The Japanese hit me painfully three times - here, here and in the back. I lost consciousness. When I woke up after a very long time, I was covered in blood, but I didn’t know. what happened." Xia Shuqin's family consisted of 7 people, but only she and her 4-year-old sister survived. She noted: “My uncle and his children took refuge in the security zone, and when I lost my house, they took me there too.” 
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        Nanjing Massacre survivor Xia Shuqin stressed: “I want justice for those who died. Even if I am the only survivor, I will fight for Japan to admit its guilt. Then and only then will I achieve peace and stop talking about it.”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The survivors of that terrible time are desperately awaiting repentance from the Japanese side. They leave one after another - the list of victims on the memorial wall grows longer. And the more names there are in it, the more strongly it is imprinted in history. According to the Chinese side, during 6 weeks of atrocities, the Japanese military killed about 300 thousand residents of Nanjing with particular cruelty, and thousands of women were subjected to violence.

                        Today, The Nanjing Massacre is also known as “The Rape of Nanjing,” which represents gender-based violence directly and inspirs fictional writers to depict the tragedy of women. Yan Geling’s novel The Flowers of War and Zhang Yimou’s film adapted from that novel are examples. In this article, through a comparison of Iris Chang’s The Rape of Nanking and two versions of The Flowers of War, I examine how Yan and Zhang apply the historical materials to portray the interaction between women and calamity. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Iris Chang in her novel presents "rape" from a global viewpoint in The Rape of Nanking. First, women are raped by patriarchy. Women were in grave peril in the male-dominated society of East Asia. Women were trained to be soft and meek by society, but when the conflict actually broke out, males gave up and ran away. Another definition of "rape" is when a greater nation mistreats a weaker one. Stronger nations refused China's request for assistance throughout the conflict and later forgot the Nanjing Massacre. Chang, on the other hand, interprets "rape" from a single point of view and is able to uncover "hope" in the conflict when he transforms the Nanjing Massacre into fictional works. 
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        Yan Geling describes the issues with patriarchy in the novel The Flowers of War but fails to effectively depict the larger global picture. She describes how women employ their mature reproductive organs to give birth (again). In contrast, Zhang Yimou places a strong emphasis on the global setting in his movie. He puts out the notion that the dying Oriental civilisation may be saved by the Western faith. In this thesis, I contend that although Zhang looks to Western cultures as an external force to heal Chinese trauma, Yan depicts how the inner strength of Chinese women's bodies helps them overcome the crisis of death in the novel The Flowers of War. However, both of these narrative ploys highlight the following issues: Yan depicts the mistreatment of women, whereas Zhang displays the self-Orientalism tendency.

                        “In 1937, on the 11 day of the 11 lunar month, the Japanese army occupied the city. After taking over the city, they massacred residents and set the area on fire. The Japanese forces slaughtered my husband and my older brother.  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We ran away at that point and took refuge in Dafang Lane. My children were five and three years old. I was also pregnant.  My husband Li Dianrong was taken away by the Japanese army when he sent us quilts. I sobbed while looking everywhere for him. But all I found were the quilts. My spouse was not one of the dead when I removed the reed mat to look at them. Later, I learned that the Japanese soldiers killed my husband. We had to go to the Huai'an countryside since we were unable to live without him and with only the aged and young in the family. Japanese forces also killed my older brother. And my mother died in sadness because of the death of her son and son-in-law. 
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        I personally witnessed a Japanese soldier hacking a pedestrian in the back, splitting him in half, and causing him to collapse to the ground. Additionally, two more soldiers killed.  The Japanese soldiers hacked off the other man's head and kicked it with their foot after tearing open the stomach of one of the men.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The current location of No. 4 Middle School, which at the time was known as Sanmin Middle School, the library, and IWHR were all in the neighborhood of numerous deaths caused by the Japanese army at that time. Additionally, several civilians outside Hanzhong Gate were shot by machine guns”.
