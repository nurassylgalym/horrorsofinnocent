                            The civil war in Syria, which began in 2011, gave rise to numerous protests and demonstrations. This conflict situation compelled Syrian citizens to take to the streets to express their discontent and demands for the government.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            One of the most well-known protests occurred in March 2011 in the city of Daraa. Protesters demanded the release of political prisoners and political reforms. However, this peaceful protest was brutally suppressed, leading to further protests and an escalation of the conflict. Over time, many other protests and mass actions spread across Syria. Protesters made diverse demands, including freedom of speech, free elections, and the departure of President Bashar al-Assad. These protests often escalated into violence and armed actions.

                            <br>    
                            As for terrorist organizations in Syria, one of the most infamous was the "Islamic State Group" (ISIS). This extremist organization entered Syria in 2013 and began seizing territories, such as Raqqa, conducting ruthless attacks, and establishing control over various cities and regions. Their goal was to establish an Islamic caliphate. Another significant group was "Al-Qaeda in Syria," known as "Jabhat al-Nusra." This organization also actively participated in the armed conflict, fighting against the government and other opposition forces.

                            The Syrian civil war has caused immense suffering for the local population and had global repercussions. Protests and terrorist organizations have become an integral part of this bloody conflict situation, which continues to this day...

                            Syria is a country with a rich cultural and historical heritage, and its women play an important role in society. However, recent years of war and conflict have affected the lifestyle of Syrian women. In this article, we will look at how women from Syria live in conditions of instability, how they dress and how their days pass.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Syrian women, like men, face a difficult reality in a military conflict. Many of them have lost their homes, loved ones and sources of income. However, they showed incredible endurance and fortitude to support their families and society. However, it is worth noting that Syrian women face various challenges, such as restrictions on mobility and access to education and healthcare. Many of them are also experiencing emotional stress and stress due to the conflict.
                            <br>
                            <br>    
                            As for clothing, Syrian women tend to wear traditional clothing such as an abaya or hijab. However, in big cities you can see a variety of styles and fashion trends, especially among young people. The style of clothing may vary depending on religious and cultural beliefs.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            As for daily life, Syrian women, depending on the situation, can engage in various types of activities. Some work to provide for their families, others are engaged in volunteering and helping refugees. They also participate in socio-cultural activities to maintain their traditions and society.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            In conclusion, Syrian women, despite difficult circumstances, continue to live and support their families and society. Their cultural heritage and role in Syrian society remain important, and their efforts deserve respect and support.

                            Children in Syria face incredible hardships while living in a country torn apart by war and conflicts. This conflict, which began in 2011, has left children without a normal childhood and access to basic rights...
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Many children in Syria grew up in constant fear and distress. The sounds of explosions and gunfire became a part of their daily lives. Over 30% of children lost their parents, friends, and homes due to the fighting. This has led to serious psychological trauma and stress for many of them.
                            <br>
                            <br>    
                             Education also suffers in the conditions of war. Many schools and nurseries have been destroyed, and children are deprived of access to education. Most of them are forced to remain illiterate, seriously undermining their future prospects and aspirations.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                             In addition, children and adolescents face a lack of basic necessities such as food and medical aid. Hunger and disease have become a part of their daily lives, and many of them suffer from malnutrition and preventable illnesses.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Despite all these hardships, children in Syria display incredible resilience and determination. They dream of a peaceful and better future, and many of them continue to hope for a brighter tomorrow, despite the horrors of this civil war.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Syrian children require assistance and support from the global community. They deserve safety, education, and the opportunity to realize their potential. Their resilience and hope for the future should inspire all of us because all children in this world deserve love and care.

                            By 2010, Syria was the fastest-growing and most dynamically developing country in the Middle East. The standard of living was comparable to that of Israel and Kuwait. Syria had a thriving economy, including agriculture, the oil industry, and tourism. The country had significant economic potential and played a crucial role in the region. Syria invested in education, and the level of education was relatively high, with access to healthcare ensured.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In the heart of Damascus, there were around 2,000 mosques and churches, creating a multicultural and multi-religious society characterized by coexistence and cultural exchange. People lived without significant conflicts and dressed as they pleased. Women wore jeans and mini-skirts, while men strolled with their families on the streets. Residents walked the streets at night without much fear. Women and men had equal opportunities in employment and education, among other things. In the city center, there were nightclubs, bars, hotels, and a water park for tourists. Approximately 100 tourists visited the city almost every month. 
                            <br>
                            <br>    
                            Everyone was curious about how a country with such a rich culture and ancient history was evolving. Syria is known for its rich history, including archaeological discoveries related to civilizations that existed here for millennia. But in June 2011, Syria's fate took a 180-degree turn...

                            Civil War in Syria... Since the beginning of the civil war in Syria in 2011, the country has faced destruction, human suffering, and global consequences. The conflict has affected every aspect of Syrians' lives and has caused significant changes in world politics. Millions of Syrians were forced to leave their homes due to bombings and violence. Internal displacement and refugees became a massive problem. Many of them encountered shortages of food, water, and medical assistance.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                             Furthermore, the war has led to the destruction of a significant part of the country's infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, and roads. This left Syrians without access to basic services and created a humanitarian catastrophe. As a result, one-third of Syrians lost their jobs and homes.
                            <br>
                            <br>    
                            What were the geopolitical consequences in Syria? The conflict in Syria attracted the attention of numerous world powers, including Russia, the United States, Turkey, and others. This resulted in complex interactions and external interests, including support for different sides of the conflict.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In 2014-15, terrorist organizations such as ISIS began to actively operate in Syria. The conflict created conditions for their growth and expansion, posing a serious threat to the region and the world.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Syrians continue to suffer from this war, and the resolution of the conflict remains one of the main global priorities. The international community must collaborate to achieve peace and assist those affected.

                    <p>“Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. This is not a way of life at all in any true sense. Under the clouds of war, it is humanity hanging on a cross of iron.” ― Dwight D. Eisenhower </p>
                    <p>“It is not seen as insane when a fighter, under an attack that will inevitable lead to his death, chooses to take his own life first. In fact, this act has been encouraged for centuries, and is accepted even now as an honorable reason to do the deed. How is it any different when you are under attack by your own mind?” ― Emilie Autumn, The Asylum for Wayward Victorian Girls</p>
