                            Conflict disrupts societies and individual families; violence against women proliferates. Though war is perceived as a male activity—and indeed, those involved in militaristic actions are overwhelmingly men—it is largely civilian women and children who bear the costs of the many civil wars of our time. 
                            <br>
                            <br>    
                            The Bosnian War affected women intensely and disastrously. In addition to the complications of caring for a family during wartime, women there faced displacement from home, separation from loved ones, and extreme abuse, including rape, torture, and death. According to the statistics by Intereconomics, approximately half of the displaced Bosnian women fled to Serbia, Montenegro, and Croatia. The vast majority of the other half, consisting largely of Muslim Bosniaks, fled to Western European countries.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The flight and forced migration of refugees during the war took place under a wide range of conditions, from women fleeing with their families to women being kidnapped by rebel forces. And the journeys themselves have a remarkable variety of dangers, from robbers preying on the travelers to landmines blowing them up. Women who escape from their homes, communities, and countries face hardships beyond their control, especially during times of conflict.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            -   "We headed for the unknown, overwhelmed by fear," recalls a woman from Sarajevo, Bosnia, of her flight.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            -   "We passed through the part of the city where all the houses were burned, destroyed, and deserted. I left behind all the comfort I had, which I experienced as major violence," recalls another woman from Tuzla, Bosnia. On the road, women were forced to trade sex for food, sustenance, or protection.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            "Our bodies were exchanged for food. The rebels were in charge of all the food in the country at that time. Some women who had pride and high esteem would rather die from hunger. But if you wanted to live, you had to have some connection with a rebel", states a woman who survived the Bosnian war that began in 1992. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Forced migration affects everyone, but for most of the world’s women, the home is the most important place in the world, providing shelter, a space to nurture children, possible respite from violence in the streets, and, for some women, their only locus of social activities. Thus, women may be disproportionately affected psychologically and physically by being forced out of their homes and having those dwellings destroyed.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            However, despite all the difficulties, many women played an important role during the war and after it. They became activists, helped organize humanitarian aid, defended women's rights and fought for justice. Women's organizations and initiatives were created that contributed to the restoration and overcoming of the consequences of the war. Today, many women who survived the Bosnian War continue to fight for their rights and participate in the process of peace building and reconciliation. Their stories and experiences are an important lesson for society and a reminder of the need to prevent violence and protect women's rights during conflicts

                            "You destroy communities. You punish the men, and you punish the women, doing it in front of the men. It has probably become more dangerous to be a woman than a soldier in armed conflict,"  states Major-General Patrick Cammaert. 
                            <br>
                            <br>    
                            The Serb aggressors and Croat extremists violated women’s rights through various atrocities and the infliction of terror. The mass and systematic rape of women of all ages, stressing that the majority had been Muslim women, was one of the most complex manifestations of aggression, the policy of ethnic cleansing, and a particular form of genocide. In some cases, men prove their power and humiliate the enemy by raping old women who live alone, so that their helplessness is increased by the absence of any protector. As a woman from Bosnia said, in the Bosnian town of Foca, Serbs raped and killed a 90-year-old woman who lived alone. Another woman, 78 years old, who also lived alone and was ill, was raped and tortured by Serbs in her house in Brcko; she died from the violence. Those actions were premeditated, carefully organized, and meant as acts to humiliate, shame, and degrade the entire ethnic group.
                            <br>
                            <br>    
                            According to patriarchal principles, women are the male enemy's property, and they should be used as an instrument to defeat the enemy. As Brownmiller writes, "a simple rule of thumb in war is that the winning side is the side that does the raping. First, a victorious army marches through the defeated people's territory, and thus it is obvious that if there is any raping to be done, it will be done on the bodies of the defeated enemy's women". Men from the losing side also rape, but as a means to retaliate and get revenge.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Thus, rape becomes a manifestation of the heroic fighting man engaged in a good fight. When roles are changed and the former losers become winners, they also tend to demonstrate their power and finally defeat the enemy. This was the case with the Russian soldiers who raped German women at the end of World War I. This was also the case in the Bosnian War, where the nationality of rapists depended on the balance of power in geographic areas.

                            When the Dayton agreement was signed in November, 1995, finishing the Bosnian war, more than 2 million people had been internally displaced in Bosnia and Herzegovina, measuring to more than half of the populace of the republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That included the widows of Srebrenica. Most of these displaced individuals ended up in 23 refugee camps, set up rapidly to solve the immediate issue of communities torn from their homes and families tore separated. But these temporary camps never went away—in reality, numerous widows, their children, and presently indeed their grandchildren proceed to live in these places.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            “My life is a total mess.”
                            <br>
                            <br>    
                            Hazira has been living in one of these refugee camps with her daughter, son, and new partner, for 26 years, starting in 1994. Her life has never been the same despite the fact that she escaped the war and the Srebrenica atrocity. Even though her family had been forced to flee during the war, they were glad to be back home as soon as peace was declared: She traveled to Bljeevo with her family in 1995. However, something went wrong.  Her younger sister rushed excitedly towards the wreckage of the house that had once been their home. Her father tried to stop her, but all he could hear was the explosion of the land mine. Hazira's sister lost both of her legs at their front door. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            No member of Hazira’s extended family ever returned to their home village again. Since then, she decided to stay in the refugee camp forever. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            With the help of tranquilizers and sleeping pills, like most women in the refugee center, Hazira struggles to make it through the early hours of the morning. Her own therapy is to maniacally tidy up her house, cultivating the garden and gathering firewood.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            “I worry so much that I can’t sleep. I get up at 5 am. I think about what I’m going to cook, what we’re going to eat, and then I’m off to get us firewood,” she says.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Overall, the refugee communities in the Tuzla area are slowly becoming less populated. Some people rebuilt the family homes they had to leave during the war using contributions, and others were given apartments in housing developments created by the canton of Tuzla and neighboring towns. Although they are being relocated together once more, the trauma brought on by the conflict and living in refugee camps will not be quickly removed, and neither will the new home in the apartment complexes make it simpler for them to assimilate with the local community.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            On another hand, many continue to live in refugee camps, in living quarters in dire need of repair. So does the Hazira, maniacally clean, wash, and tidy up to maintain at least an illusion of a normal life in this stigmatized environment.

                        ‘Mirsada’ was 15 years old when she was taken to a rape camp near Srebrenica. Here, she talks to us about what happened to her, and the extraordinary courage of the Bosnian women who have survived sexual violence. For many survivors in Bosnia, stigma and shame prevent them from speaking out about their experiences, but Mirsada is adamant that their stories need to be shared to prevent future atrocities. She was fifteen years old when the war began. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        “I lived in the Srebrenica municipality. Bosniaks and Serbs lived there together – I couldn’t see any difference between us. It was not until the war started in 1991 in Croatia that I had a clue who was Croat, who was Serb, who was Muslim. Then, at the beginning of 1992, Serbs started to move out of my village. They just disappeared. The rumours began that there would be war in Bosnia too, but we didn’t think it could happen to us. 
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        That is where the nightmare really began. Someone was banging on the door of the room we were in, but we didn’t dare to get up. A soldier broke the door down. There were about eleven soldiers there who had just arrived. I knew a lot of them. They said they were going to safe us , but they lied. Instead they drove us to the front of some other house, where they raped us again.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        That night I was repeatedly raped by several soldiers. Some of them I knew. Some were strangers to me. It lasted the whole night.”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Mirsada and the other girls were kept as prisoners for weeks in various abandoned houses, restaurants and buildings. Eventually she was moved to a refugee camp at the Lagator Sports Centre in Loznica.  Over the following months, Mirsada was again moved from place to place, this time as a refugee. She had no idea if her family was alive until August 1993, when she found out via the Red Cross that her family was alive and living in the UN ‘safe zone’ of Srebrenica. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Like many sexual violence survivors, she has struggled in the aftermath of the war. For many women, the cycle of violence does not end with war, but moves from public to private. This is exactly what happened to Mirsada:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        “I had problems in my marriage, which are related to what we suffered in the war. My husband physically and mentally humiliated me. It felt as though I was living in a vicious cycle with no way out. Finally, I decided to get divorced and a new fight started for me. I was unemployed with two children. I had to clean houses to earn some money. I worked all the time to get away from the pain.”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Despite all of the issues she has faced, Mirsada has shown extraordinary courage and resilience. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        “I was only a girl of 15 when this happened to me, but I survived.  I will carry that burden of pain all my life. The past will always be with me. But I try and live as normal a life as possible.”
